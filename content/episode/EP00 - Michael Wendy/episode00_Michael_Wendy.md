People making huge salaries golden handcuff how do you go that's going to be a hard transition to go get out of Bella's getting that salary and having a lifestyle and I on the other hand you have things being pushed down to like super cheap work you value in design and then there's not much left in the middle I think a lot of that it has to do with the cost of living and the salaries that you can get at certain places some of it I think is also just a product of Technology being easier to make things like Squarespace and bring it back to dumb as we used to sell small websites that were very affordable and help pay the bills and these times I would never recommend"
